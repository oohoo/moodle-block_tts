removed debug from SM2 and using minified version.
changed css to start controls in top right corner.
changed float object interval to longer interval in hopes of
reducing script overhead.  10 frames per second might be ugly.

Proposing to add a pre-prefetch step where a long array is returned.
This array of all available mp3s is returned and blocks prefetching 
until all of the mp3s are loaded.

If js can check size, see if it can invalidate browser cache and
try to download again.


Proposed
In redesign:
  
  employ patterns from JS patterns.
    mediator and modules
  
  use local variables to reduce lookup chains
  
  maybe use an anonymous construct to unpollute namespace?
  
  maybe decouple things into a mediator between the different jquery plugins and reduce my code into its own plugin
  
  change the names of some things.
  
  create a (state)control namespace instead of config.
  
  create static and protected members.  possibly implement constants via closures and implement functions to interact with them.
    //constants can be pulled via a javascript call.  use constructors to instantiate some objects through literals within functions.
    //possibly use objects and inherit them into a mediator.  mediator can use prototypes and constructors or the mediator can DEEP COPY
    //from the objects to build itself into something new.
    //other variables outside closure can be manipulated.
